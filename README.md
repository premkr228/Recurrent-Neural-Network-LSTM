# Recurrent-Neural-Network-LSTM
A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) processes sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that carries information from previous time steps. LSTM, a specialized RNN, uses input, forget, and output gates to retain important information over long sequences, overcoming vanishing gradient issues and enabling effective learning of long-term dependencies.
